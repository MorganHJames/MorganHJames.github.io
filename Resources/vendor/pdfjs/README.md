How to host PDF.js locally for the viewer

This viewer prefers local PDF.js files if present. To host PDF.js locally:

1. Download the production builds of PDF.js (matching versions are best).
   - A convenient source is the official PDF.js GitHub releases: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases
   - Download the `pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js` files from the `build/` folder of the release you want.

2. Place the files into this folder:
   Resources/vendor/pdfjs/
   - pdf.min.js
   - pdf.worker.min.js

3. Verify the paths: the viewer expects the files at `Resources/vendor/pdfjs/pdf.min.js` and `Resources/vendor/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js`.

4. The viewer will automatically try the local files first. If they are not present it will fall back to a CDN copy.

Quick helper (Windows PowerShell)

I added a small PowerShell helper script `download_pdfjs.ps1` which can download the two required files from cdnjs:

1. Open PowerShell in the `Resources/vendor/pdfjs/` folder.
2. Run:

   .\download_pdfjs.ps1 -Version 2.16.105 -Destination .\

3. Confirm the files `pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js` exist in this folder.

Notes
- Hosting the worker file locally avoids cross-origin and SRI issues and is recommended for production.
- PDF.js is Apache-2.0 licensed. Review the license if you redistribute the library.
- If you'd like, I can commit the PDF.js files into the repo for you (they're permissively licensed). Tell me and I'll add them.

- If you want me to add the library files into the repo for you, I can (they're permissively licensed), but I can't fetch them automatically in this environmentâ€”please confirm and I will add placeholders or instructions to commit them locally.
